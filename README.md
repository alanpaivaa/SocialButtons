# SocialButtons

A plugin for [Publish](https://github.com/JohnSundell/Publish) that allows you to easily embed social buttons (e.g. Tweet button) in your site.

## Installation
Add it as a dependency in `Package.swift`:

```swift
let package = Package(
    ...

    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/alanpaivaa/SocialButtons", from: "0.1.0")
    ],
    targets: [
        .target(
            name: "AmazingBlog",
            dependencies: [
                "SocialButtons"
            ]
        )
    ]
)
```

## Usage

### TweetButton
A [Tweet button](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-for-websites/tweet-button/overview) allows users easily share content from your site.

```swift
TweetButton(
    style: .small,                          // Choose small or large size
    text: "Check out my amazing article!",  // Text to be shared on the tweet
    hashTags: ["engineering", "swift"],     // Hash tags to be added on the tweet
    via: "alanpaivaa",                      // Twitter account for attribution
    related: ["other_user"]                 // Twitter accounts related to the shared content
)
```

To render the default Tweet button widget, it's also necessary to load the Twitter widget script:

```swift
HTML(
    .head(
        ...
        .loadTwitterWidgets()
    ),
    ...
)
```

If you need to customize the button, you can use a regular `Link` and build the Tweet url with `TweetURLGenerator`. In that case, it's also needed to set the `url` parameter pointing to the page to share.
